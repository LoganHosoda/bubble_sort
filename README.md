Bubble Sort, by Logan Hosoda

Simple bubble sort algorithm using recursion. Currently sorts in ascending order.

Objective: Compares the first element in an array to the next element in an array. If the second element is greater, it will swap places with the first. The process is then repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Currently there is only one method, which could potentially be broken up into more methods to simplify the algorithm. Additionally, the program doesn't return until it completes the full loop, which leaves room for potential optimization.

Otherwise, it is fully functional, and gets the job done in a theoretically decent runtime.
